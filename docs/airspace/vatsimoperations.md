## Radio Communication Differences
- Unicom instead of CTAF
- On VATSIM (Exluding VATUSA's CTAF Test) we use a standard UNICOM frequency of 122.800. Pilots are allowed to use the listed CTAF on an aerodromes chart however **MUST** monitor UNICOM and switch to it if there are other pilots in the area which would benefit from your radio calls. As good practise it is recommended that you always use 122.800 OCTA so that all traffic in the area are aware of each other and there are no conflicts
- Text and voice where text pilots known to operate in the area
- Allowance for non-standard winds/weather requiring use of reciprocal runways, etc

## Top Down Rule
- Identifying who to contact
- Use of controller ATIS to determine who is providing control services for aerodrome

## Enroute Sector Extensions
- Use of controller ATIS and VATPAC website airspace map to determine sector ownership
- VATPAC allows C1+ controllers to extend past their logged on position. This can be difficult to find who is extending where sometimes as most VATSIM maps don't show these extended sectors as being online. VATPAC recommends pilots check the [VATPAC Map](https://map.vatpac.org/){target=new} which shows all online sectors. Pilots can also manually check a controllers info to see if they have listed any sectors they are extending to. 
- Being told to contact a frequency which isn't displayed in pilot client (most foreign pilots get confused by this)
- As with the above point most VATSIM Maps don't show sectors as online when they are being extended to by a controller. This is the same for the frequencies of the sector being extended to. If you have been asked to contact a frequency that you can not see in your pilot client, try tuning and listening or contacting the controller first. If you can't hear anything or the controller isn't replying, check the VATPAC Map and compare your position to any sectors that are showing online. If you are in a sector that is showing as online, double check the frequency you have tuned is correct.
